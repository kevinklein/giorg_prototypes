At its basic form, a <code>.card</code> when used in conjunction with an additive class of <code>.card-body</code> or with a nested <code>div.card-body</code> and creates a block element with white background, a subtle border, and a slight shadow. Use this for anything: as a demarcation of content, a resource, a callout, a panel with application controls.

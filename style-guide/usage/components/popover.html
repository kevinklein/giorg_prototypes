Popovers rely on the 3rd party library tether (http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for positioning. You must include tether.min.js before the Bootstrap js (whether you call it locally, from our Assets server, or from a CDN) in order for popovers to work. Popovers require the tooltip plugin as a dependency (if you call the aggregate Bootstrap js this is included). You must initialize them yourself: <code>$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()</code>.

        <p class="faq-item toggle-target-next toggle-is-toggled m-b-sm"><strong>What should I wear to the WCOG at ACG2017?</strong></p>

        <div class="bg-info-lightest p-a faq-answer" style="display: none;">
            <p>We recommend wearing business casual attire and comfortable shoes. Presenters typically dress more formally. Meeting rooms are often cool, so layered clothing is recommended. October temperatures in Orlando typically reach the mid-80s°F (about 29°C) during the day, and mid-60s°F (about 18°C) in the evening.</p>

            <p>With the app, you will have full access to all available slide presentations for each course you register for. The app also contains a fully searchable schedule of events, list of program participants, abstracts, maps, exhibit information, and more.</p>

            <p>In addition, the app will sync with a personal itinerary that meeting attendees will be able to create using the online Itinerary Planner. You can <a href="https://www.eventscribe.com/2017/wcogacg2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a> to access the Planner now to view the full agenda.</p>

            <p>Later this year, you will be able to create an account in the Itinerary Planner that will allow you to select presentations and events to build your own personal itinerary, making it easy to prioritize your time at the conference by planning your on-site activities in advance. Once you have created an account, you will be able to access your itinerary at any time using this site, and can continue to add or remove programs to update your itinerary.</p>

            <p>Once the mobile app is available and you have downloaded it, you can synchronize your itinerary to the app and your itinerary will be available on your mobile device for you to use on-site at the meeting in Orlando. You will also have the option to allow the app to add each course or session to your personal calendar.</p>

<p>This is a "living" style and pattern guide that documents the styles, components, patterns and CSS utilities used across ACG web properties. It is based in a large part on the Bootstrap framework and was first deployed in a fundamental sense for the ACG World Congress 2017 website. Here you'll find examples of the various permutations of color, typography, layout conventions, styles, patterns, templates, application components, and other assorted goodies used on ACG production websites. As this is a "living" site, things may be in flux or active development. Also, new-ish items may be in a partial state of completion. <a href="mailto:kevin.klein@gmail.com"><b>You can always ask Kevin if you have any questions (or to report any bugs)</b></a>.</p>

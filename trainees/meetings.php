                <h3 class="text-muted"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-calendar"></use></svg> Spring, 2019</h3>
                <p>This exciting and unique opportunity is for 2nd year fellows across North America. The College, through its Training Committee, sponsors a weekend course designed specifically for the 2nd year GI fellow. ACG covers travel, lodging and meal expenses for fellows-in-training to attend this meeting.</p>
                <p>The general session topics for the 2018 course will be ABC’s of Private Practice and Academics: Your First Job, Endoscopic Therapy of Obesity, Pancreatic Cysts &amp; Approach to Pancreatic Lesions, How to Manage Refractory Functional GI Patients, Hands-On Manometry, Hands-On Capsule Endoscopy, and Approach to Liver Lesions<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In addition, there will be three breakout sessions on the following topics:&nbsp;Hands-On EMR, Fertility and Pregnancy in IBD and Communicating with Patients.</p>
                <p>Attendees rotate through the three breakout sessions in small groups. These case centered discussions by the experts follow a meet-the-professor format to encourage two-way discussion between the fellows and faculty. The focus is practical, i.e., how you would approach this patient and what tests you would order, in addition to the form of therapy.</p>
                <p>The link to the Nomination website is sent in July directly to the GI Program Directors, who then nominate a second year fellow from their program to attend this meeting. Space is limited to 125 fellows from across North America. Nominations will be accepted from July 17 – August 14, 2017. If accepted into the course, the nominee must be able to arrive in Washington, DC by 6:00 pm on January 12, 2018.</p>

                <h2><a name="NACGF"></a>North American Conference of GI Fellows (NACGF)</h2>
                <h3 class="text-muted"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-calendar"></use></svg> March 26–29, 2019</h3>
                <p>ACG offers the North American Conference of GI Fellows (NACGF) as an annual program for fellows. Sponsored by the American College of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology, NACGF includes research presentations by the Fellows, along with lectures, breakout sessions and coaching by a distinguished faculty of gastroenterologists. The conference is normally held between February and April and attendance at the conference is limited to twenty-five Fellows and is by invitation only. To contend for an invitation, Fellows must submit an abstract of their research via the website, <a href="http://members.gi.org/nacgf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.nacgf.org</a>. Abstract submissions usually take place between mid-November through mid-January. Updated information regarding the program can be found on this website.</p>
                <p>A Fellow may submit up to three abstracts. The research should be based on clinical or basic science gastroenterology projects with which the Fellows have been involved, including work in progress or case reports with comprehensive literature reviews. Fellows will be selected competitively to receive invitations, based on their submitted abstracts. All Fellows attending the conference will be honored with a certificate of attendance. Each year, some Fellows attending the conference will be selected to receive Distinguished Achievement Awards, which include a $1000 travel award to the ACG Annual Meeting held in October of the same year.</p>
                <p>Covered expenses for Fellows attending the conference include hotel accommodations, group meals, round-trip coach airfare and transfer between the hotel and the airport. Departures will not be scheduled before Sunday morning. Spouses/Guests are not included in the conference or at any conference activities, including meals. Spouses/Guests may accompany the Fellow on the trip at their own expense. Although the conference is held at a prime family vacation area, it is a three-day working conference and each Fellow’s attendance is expected at all events. Children, other family members and guests are discouraged from attending with the Fellow unless absolutely necessary.</p>

                    <p>Once again, a special lunch exclusively for Fellows-in-Training will be offered on Sunday, October 7, 2018 during the Postgraduate Course.
